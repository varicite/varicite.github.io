# Varicite

Varicite is a producer of fobs. 
A Fob is an object that can take the form of a small electrical device, a piece of jewelry, or a counterweight to watches. As jewelry, the qualities of the fob itself are enjoyed like a piece of art. Varicite makes fobs that are like jewelry or art. They have no real function other than to be enjoyed for their intrinsic qualities.

## Varicite Fobs

The design for the fob will be manifested in the form of an SVG file.
This SVG file will then be used to cut the fob out of plastic acrylic.

### The Current Series of Fobs

The current series of fobs will consist of a series of shapes and figures, all made with various styles. These fobs will also come in different sizes.
